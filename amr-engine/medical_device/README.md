## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
import asyncio
from medical_device import (
    AMRRiskManagementSystem,
    ClinicalEvaluationManager,
    SoftwareValidationFramework,
    PostMarketSurveillanceSystem,
    MedicalDeviceDocumentationManager,
    RegulatorySubmissionManager,
    ComplianceMonitoringSystem
)

async def main():
    # Initialize risk management
    risk_system = AMRRiskManagementSystem()
    risk_analysis = await risk_system.comprehensive_risk_analysis()
    
    # Generate clinical evaluation
    clinical_eval = ClinicalEvaluationManager()
    clinical_results = await clinical_eval.execute_clinical_evaluation()
    
    # Perform software validation
    validation_framework = SoftwareValidationFramework()
    validation_results = await validation_framework.execute_verification_protocol()
    
    # Start compliance monitoring
    monitoring = ComplianceMonitoringSystem()
    await monitoring.start_continuous_monitoring()
    
    print("Medical device compliance framework initialized successfully")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Generate Complete Documentation Package

```python
async def generate_complete_documentation():
    doc_manager = MedicalDeviceDocumentationManager()
    documentation_package = await doc_manager.generate_complete_documentation_package()
    
    print(f"Documentation package generated: {documentation_package['package_file']}")
    print(f"FDA submission readiness: {documentation_package['submission_readiness']['fda_510k_readiness']['overall_readiness']}")

asyncio.run(generate_complete_documentation())
```

### Prepare Regulatory Submissions

```python
async def prepare_regulatory_submissions():
    submission_manager = RegulatorySubmissionManager()
    global_submissions = await submission_manager.prepare_global_submissions()
    
    print(f"FDA 510(k) readiness: {global_submissions['submission_readiness']['fda_readiness']['readiness_score']}")
    print(f"EU MDR readiness: {global_submissions['submission_readiness']['eu_readiness']['readiness_score']}")

asyncio.run(prepare_regulatory_submissions())
```

## 📊 Compliance Dashboard

The compliance monitoring system provides real-time dashboards for:

- **Quality Metrics**: Document control, CAPA management, training completion
- **Safety Metrics**: Risk control effectiveness, adverse event rates, safety signals
- **Performance Metrics**: System availability, response times, clinical accuracy
- **Regulatory Metrics**: Standards compliance rates, submission readiness

## 🔧 Configuration

### QMS Configuration
Edit `quality_management/qms_config.yaml` to customize:
- Device classification and intended use
- Quality procedures and responsibilities
- Risk management parameters
- Training and competency requirements

### Risk Management Configuration
Configure risk analysis parameters in the risk management system:
- Severity and probability scales
- Risk acceptability criteria
- Control measure categories
- Review frequencies
