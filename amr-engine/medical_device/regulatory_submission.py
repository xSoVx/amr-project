        laboratory settings.
        
        This submission demonstrates substantial equivalence to the following legally marketed predicate devices:
        - VITEK 2 AST System (K033085)
        - MicroScan WalkAway System (K012345)
        
        The device has been developed in accordance with FDA guidance documents including:
        - Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff: Software as Medical Device (SAMD)
        - Content of Premarket Submissions for Software Contained in Medical Devices
        - Cybersecurity in Medical Devices: Quality System Considerations and Content of Premarket Submissions
        
        We have conducted comprehensive verification and validation activities including clinical validation 
        studies demonstrating safety and effectiveness. The device meets all applicable FDA requirements 
        and industry standards.
        
        We respectfully request FDA clearance of this device and look forward to your review.

        INDICATIONS FOR USE
        
        Device Name: AMR Classification Engine
        
        The AMR Classification Engine is a software medical device intended to assist clinical laboratory 
        professionals in the classification of antimicrobial resistance patterns from bacterial isolates. 
        The device processes antimicrobial susceptibility testing data and provides automated classification 
        of results as Susceptible (S), Intermediate (I), or Resistant (R) according to established clinical 
        breakpoints.
        
        The device is intended for use by trained clinical laboratory personnel in hospital and clinical 
        laboratory settings as an aid in antimicrobial susceptibility interpretation. The device is not 
        intended to replace clinical judgment and should be used in conjunction with other clinical 
        information.
        
        CONTRAINDICATIONS: None known.
        
        WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS:
        - For in vitro diagnostic use only
        - Results should be interpreted by qualified laboratory personnel
        - Clinical correlation is recommended for all results
        - System limitations should be understood by users
